# TimeAndCalendarSystem
V 0.0.3

All the time elements for Precious Hector: Corpse Collector, a game in development
in Unity C#, decoupled for versatility. 

This system includes communication with the system clock, an internal game clock, 
an internal calendar, and a time-of-day based behavior system. 

Currently very much a work-in-progress, but I try to write as explicitly as I can
so that anyone can follow along.
